# qc-batteries
Hybrid QC–PINN toolkit for Li–S batteries. This repository collects reproducible notebooks and code that combine Qiskit-based quantum circuits (e.g., VQE/expectation values for Li–S molecular motifs) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for 1D reaction–transport modeling of lithium–sulfur batteries.
